Empower your workflow and bring your product dreams to life with the code automation tools reliable solutions!

## Purpose of the Code Automation Tool

Previously, RSB Transmission Ltd. relied on a lengthy and manual process for item code creation. Employees would first compile a list of relevant product data in an Excel sheet. This information was then emailed to a designated master knowledge expert within the company, who would verify the data for accuracy. Utilizing Excel macros, the expert would validate the information and subsequently generate the item code and product description.

This manual workflow was not only time-consuming but also contributed to delays in demand and supply, ultimately affecting production efficiency. Recognizing the need for improvement, the Code Automation Tool was developed to streamline this process, enabling quicker, more accurate item code generation while enhancing overall operational efficiency.
